## Data source ##

This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Please refer to README.txt inside **Dataset.zip** (link below) to know how this experience was conducted.

Inside the **Dataset.zip** you're going to find a file called ** features_info.txt** which explains the variables of the dataset. Excerpt below:`

## Former variables from the unformatted data ##

*The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.*

(... see ** features_info.txt** ...)

*In short, for this derived dataset, these signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.*

The signals generated by the device are:

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

* mean(): Mean value
* std(): Standard deviation
* mad(): Median absolute deviation
* max(): Largest value in array
* min(): Smallest value in array
* sma(): Signal magnitude area
* energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.
* iqr(): Interquartile range
* entropy(): Signal entropy
* arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
* correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
* maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal
* kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal
* bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
* angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean

The result of this combination is a set of 561 variables in this format:

tBodyAcc-mean()-X
tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
tBodyAcc-std()-X
tBodyAcc-std()-Y
tBodyAcc-std()-Z
tBodyAcc-mad()-X
tBodyAcc-mad()-Y
tBodyAcc-mad()-Z
tBodyAcc-max()-X
tBodyAcc-max()-Y
tBodyAcc-max()-Z
tBodyAcc-min()-X
tBodyAcc-min()-Y
tBodyAcc-min()-Z
tBodyAcc-sma()
tBodyAcc-energy()-X
tBodyAcc-energy()-Y
tBodyAcc-energy()-Z
tBodyAcc-iqr()-X
tBodyAcc-iqr()-Y
tBodyAcc-iqr()-Z

## Transformation ##

For this assignment, we had to:

* Combine train and test sets 
* keep mean() and std() variables only (mean and standard deviation)
* Add a descriptive column of Activity
* Add labels to all columns
* Generate a tidy file with the average of all variables by Subject and Activity

## tidy.csv file ##

* SubjectID - unique ID of user of the device                  
* ActivityID - unique ID of the Activity 
* ActivityName - unique name of the Activity

Follow are the variables collected from the device AVERAGED by ID+Activity
